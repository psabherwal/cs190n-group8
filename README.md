## PROBLEM 
Videos from streaming platforms are downloaded in chunks and fluctuations in network performance can result in rebuffering, essentially lowering the quality of user experience. To minimize the interruptions caused by loading delays, our project aims to predict the time needed to download the next video chunk. By accurately predicting these download times, streaming platforms such as YouTube and Tubi can adjust video quality or pre-buffer data to reduce loading interruptions, while improving user experience. 

## MOTIVATION
*What is the motivation for the problem? What is the exact specification of the problem?* 

The motivation for this problem stems from the increasing demand for high-quality video streaming without interruptions. Popular streaming platforms rely on dynamic adaptation of video quality to match network conditions and avoid buffering. The problem involves the use of machine learning to predict the download time of video chunks based on the data provided from previous video chunks.
