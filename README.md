## PROBLEM 
Videos from streaming platforms are downloaded in chunks and fluctuations in network performance can result in rebuffering, essentially lowering the quality of user experience. To minimize the interruptions caused by loading delays, our project aims to predict the time needed to download the next video chunk. By accurately predicting these download times, streaming platforms such as YouTube and Tubi can adjust video quality or pre-buffer data to reduce loading interruptions, while improving user experience.
